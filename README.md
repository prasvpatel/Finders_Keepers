# Finders_Keepers
Build by Prashant Patel, Rushil Patel, Andy Ho, Bill Wong for RUHacks 2017!

## Main Objective

The main objective of the game is to produce a fun, competitive, and unique prototype of a game that can be played on pc and potential android. We wanted to create a different type of game than those ever experienced! With little experience with game development, we set out on a journey in which we little we knew was filled with a lot of bugs!

## What it Does

Finder's Keepers is a PC Game built for the Mac OS and Windows system in which the player has a certain time limit to find hidden objects in the room. Some of these objects are easy to find, while some take some time. With a time limit of only 1:30, it takes many tries to master this game. Once these objects are found, the player can safely exit the room. This game combines both the idea of escape room and hide and seek to make a game called Finder's Keepers!

## Problems

Dreams were made to be dreams: The original game idea was a escape room type game where the special gimmick was to use paintings and various artifacts in the environment to access secrets, however due to various factors like indecisiveness of whether to use Unity or Unreal Engine, as well as the team's inexperience with the Unreal Engine, turned the game into a side and seek shooter. We also had a teammate whose this was their first hackathon and two teammates whose it was their second hackathon and first 36 hour hackathon. Our final teammate was an experienced hacker who carried us at this hackathon despite the challenges which we faced for virtual reality. We spent a massive time trying to connect the Samsung Gear VR and the Oculus Rift to the Unity Engine without any luck. We resorted to Unreal Engine and built a PC Game at the end!

## The Future

The future of the game is extremely undetermined but the bare bones include making the game multiplayer and having background music going on to intensify the game! Currently, adding music into the game makes the game extremely laggy to operate but we are currently looking for a way behind this!

## Built With
This PC Game was built with Unreal Engine which uses C++ and Java. IT was firstly prototyped in Unity by two of our team members by using C#!
